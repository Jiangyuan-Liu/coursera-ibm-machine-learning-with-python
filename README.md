# Machine Learning with Python by IBM (Coursera)

## ðŸŽ“ Course Summary

This course provided a **hands-on introduction to core machine learning concepts** using Python and scikit-learn. Through interactive Jupyter Notebook labs, I gained practical experience in data preprocessing, building predictive models, and evaluating performance.

I explored:  
- **Regression methods**: Linear, multiple linear, polynomial, and logistic regression.  
- **Supervised learning algorithms**: Decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
- **Unsupervised learning**: Clustering (k-Means, hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.  
- **Model tuning and evaluation**: Cross-validation, regularization, and pipeline optimization.

The course concluded with a **rainfall prediction project** and a **comprehensive final exam**, reinforcing practical application of ML workflows.

I now have a strong foundation in **Python-based machine learning**, combining theoretical understanding with applied skills for real-world data analysis.
